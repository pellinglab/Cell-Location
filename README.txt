Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) based Python script for detecting mouse clicks on image files. The script will detect, mark with a green circle, and record the location of a mouse- click # in the X,Y coordinate system. The user has the option to batch process images by providing the path to a folder containing images. The script will automatically export the data as an xlsx file. 

OpenCV supports TIFF, JPEG, PNG and JPEG2000. To find out more about reading image files,please refer to the documentation page: https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/d4/da8/group__imgcodecs.html
